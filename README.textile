h2. mq

A Rails gem that generates an MVC stack that does email queuing

h3. What it does

I got tired of dealing with crappy email queuing systems in Rails, so I wrote my own. mq is a generator that generates an MVC stack for queuing emails. It has a UI too.

h3. Requirements

An existing Mailer model

h3. How to Install

<pre>sudo gem install mdarby-mq -s http://gems.github.com</pre>

h3. How to Use

Generate the files necessary for your app:
<pre>./script/generate mq EmailModelName MailerModelName</pre>

mq requires your Mailer methods accept an email address as its first parameter, so a Mailer method should look like:
<pre>PostOffice.send_email_method(email_address)</pre>

Queue an email:
<pre>Email.queue(:send_email_method, "matt@matt-darby.com")</pre>

h3. Delivery of queued email

<pre>
  # Assuming you choose to name your EmailModelName "Email"
  cd /path/to/your/app && ./script/runner/Email.deliver_all
</pre>

h3. How to Test

Complete Rspec specs are included automatically. Well, complete aside from view specs as you'll just change the damned things anyway.
